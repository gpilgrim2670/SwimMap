# SwimMap

`SwimMap` contains all the results from the 2018-2019 NCAA swimming season, combined with US News and World Report rankings and other information for all schools, and Google Maps data about the location of each school.

The intent is to allow an athlete who is considering swimming in college to search for schools that fit them athletically, academically, financially and with respect to location.

## The Program Finder Tab
As such one can search for schools with a desired range of performances in a given race, with a certainrange of tuition costs, and academic rankings within regions of the US and see what's available.

## The Program Comparisons Tab
Similarlly one can compare the range of times in a given race across several candidate schools and also view tuition costs, rankings etc.

## The Division Comparisons Tab
Here one can see a breakdown of each division (I, II, III) by school type and read a brief discussion on scholarship rules for each.
